Finally managed to get Unity to Server to Webapp communication to work in both directions.
Pressing tasks:
- Redo the current ticket queue and order resolution. At the moment, pressing 'End Turn' just fires the same ability again and again.
- Redo the Abilities
- MAYBE start on character selection screen. Then I can start progressing more linearly through the work.
